## About

Give a short introduction to this game, including any hints, how-tos, and play-throughs.

DEEPROOT is a casual score-based arcade-style game.

You play as a root burrowing into the ground, in search of water. Avoid rocks and collect enough water to enter TURBO MODE! The difficulty increases over time. Gain score over time, and by collecting water, or destroying rocks while in turbo mode.

The controls are displayed on the title screen.
